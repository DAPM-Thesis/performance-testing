In this experiment we test the time it takes for a subscriber to catch up to backpressure. In experiment_1.txt, both the BackpressureSource in orgA and the BackpressureSink are writing to the (same file). In experiment 2, We just wanted to see how the progression of backpressure dropped; so we do not care about "experiment_2.txt", but only "latency_of_experiment_2.txt" for plotting purposes. Note that each latency measurement in latency_of_experiment_2 is in milliseconds (and not nanoseconds), and that only every 2500th observation was written.

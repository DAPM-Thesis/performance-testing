In these experiments, orgA's src/main/java/templates/AlignmentSource, and similarly in orgB the AlignmentSink, are used to test Whether messages are correctly sent and received: In post-processing, we ensure that no messages are lost, and that the messages arrive in the correct order. In both experiment 1 and 2, 5,200 messages are produced. experiment_1.txt has a 0.75 ms sleep in the source (if (counter % 4 != 0) { Thread.sleep(1); }). experiment_2.txt has no sleep. Both the sink and the source write to a file for each experiment.

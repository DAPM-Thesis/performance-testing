experiment_1.txt contains an experiment. In this experiment, we test the time it takes from sending a message to receiving it (including serialization and deserialization). The sent message is quite simple: Just a (Java) Instant. The experiment is run for 2 minutes, and each observation is the number of nanoseconds between time sent and received, both recorded as java Instant's. experiment_2 had maven-compiler-plugin configuration->debug->false. After experiments 1 and 2 it was clear that the queue's incoming message rate exceeded the throughput capacity. Therefore the later experiments added a Thread.sleep() to the source. The sleep was set to 20 ms for experiment 3, 2 ms for exp_4, and 1 ms for exp_5. Experiment 6 was run for only 1 minute (instead of 2), and it had approximately 0.5 milliseconds sleep between messages: It had if (counter % 2 == 0) { Thread.sleep(1); }. Experiment 7 was the same as experiment 6, except it was run for 5 minutes. Experiment 8: 5 minutes run, 1 ms sleep. Experiment 9: 5 minutes run, 0.75 ms sleep; if (counter % 4 != 0) {Thread.sleep(1);}. Experiment 10: 5 ms sleep, 5 min. control_1.txt (run from orgB src/main/experiment/LocalExperiment) is a single program where serialization and deserialization time is measured; So effectively we can distinguish between kafka latency and operations time.

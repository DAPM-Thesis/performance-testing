In experiment_1, a larger pipeline was made (see orgA/src/representations/scalability_pipeline.json). In this pipeline, two sources were producing time which was ultimately consumed by 1 sink. The sink received messages from 2 operators (each with 1 of the two sources as its message origin). It then logged every latency (time between source sent the message and sink received it) in experiment_1.txt. Each entry in the file is of the form "{pornNumber}:{latencyInNs}", where port number indicates which source the latency in nanoseconds originated from.
